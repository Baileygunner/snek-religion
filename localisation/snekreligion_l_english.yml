  snekreligion.1_desc:0 "After our brave conquistadors entered Teotihuacan, they discovered something disturbing. After the giant heathen temples were ransacked by our soldiers, they found images of a “heathen god” which bore a striking resemblance to our Lord, Snek. Some soldiers have proclaimed this to be blasphemy, but our priests are intrigued by where these people gained this knowledge."

But, as we near the anniversary, the peasants have been whispering of a new golden era. Is it time once again to slither out of obscurity? Is it time to cease waiting, and begin heralding the return of Victoria? Indeed it is! We shall weather all incoming storms and retake our island, whatever the cost may be!"
  snekreligion.2_1:0 "And weather it we shall!"
